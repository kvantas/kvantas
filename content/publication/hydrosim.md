abstract = "Simulation of the water quality in water distribution networks is an internationally accepted tool for the plan and the design of new systems and the evaluation of old ones in order to keep the drinking water clean and wholesome. Directive 98/83/EC has established specifications for the basic and preventive parameters and also, for the priority dangerous substances in drinking water. This Directive explicitly mentions that the parameter values should be maintained at the point of human consumption and not at the entry point of the network (water intake). The current valid technical specifications in Greece (Presidential Decree 696/1974) do not contain any prevision for simulating the hydraulic behavior of water distribution systems and neither for the drinking water quality analysis. Thus, while there is a long list of qualitative parameter values for drinking water, there is no institutional provision for the investigation during the design of a drinking water distribution network for the effect of the network design philosophy (network shape, simple or multiple water intake etc.) on the qualitative characteristics of the drinking water. It is well known that water quality in distribution networks is continuously changing. Therefore, the only way that these values can be examined and adjusted in advance is the simulation of the water quality in distribution networks for real or hypothetical conditions (scenarios) utilizing dynamically varying modeling programs. For this purpose the software package HYDROSIM was developed which is coded in Visual Studio .NET 2003 utilizing the source code of EPANET 2 which is a free software of Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.). The purpose of this research paper is the investigation of the effect of the design philosophy of a water distribution network on the qualitative characteristics of the drinking water and suggestions on improving the current specifications for the design of water networks in Greece."
