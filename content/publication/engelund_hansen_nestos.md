# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Most well-known sediment transport formulas have been derived using specific field or laboratory data, and this hinders their applicability worldwide. Indeed, the success of some of the top-used sediment transport formulas, in certain applications, is comparable only with their failure in others. The adaptation of established formulas to specific data of rivers and streams is a viable solution to this problem, as shown by the authors with respect to the Meyer-Peter and MÃ¼ller formula (Sidiropoulos et al., 2021). In this study, we modify the widely used Engelund and Hansen (EH, 1967) sediment transport formula and calibrate it on the basis of measured data from Nestos River in north-eastern Greece."
