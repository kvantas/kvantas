abstract = "An unsupervised machine learning method, Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components (HCPC), was applied in order to classify temporal rainfall patterns for the Water Division of Thrace. The whole process includes the following steps: (1) Raw data from the Greek National Databank for Hydro-meteorological Information coming from 13 meteorological stations were subjected to cleaning from noise and errors. (2) The critical duration of no precipitation (CD) that separates rainstorms was determined on the basis of a Poisson process hypothesis. (3) A temporal model of CD was constructed for the above rainfall data. (4) Unitless Cumulative Hyetographs (UCH) were compiled and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was applied to the UCHâ€™s. (5) The Hopkins statistic was employed in order to assess the clustering tendency and it was concluded that the dataset contained meaningful clusters. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering was applied on the Principal Components. (6) The number of clusters was determined by repetitive statistical comparisons between representatives of the clusters already produced by the HCPC of the previous steps. In conclusion, a limited number of representative design hyetographs was produced for the Thrace Water Division, thus facilitating greatly the process of disaggregation. These hyetographs can be used for stochastic simulation and for water resources planning. The present type of analysis is applied for the first time on data from a Greek region and, in addition, it presents certain characteristics for a more general applicability. Namely, the method employed is fully unsupervised and no empirical knowledge of local rainfalls was utilized. Moreover, the resulting representative hyetographs are products of the statistical and machine learning methods of the present paper, without any arbitrary introduction of quartiles for grouping, as is the case in the pertinent literature."
